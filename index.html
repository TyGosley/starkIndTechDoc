            Artificial intelligence is the cornerstone of Stark Industries, and
            the driving force behind the company's technological innovations.
            From simple creations by Stark Standards like creating a robotic Arm
            to assist him in his lab or the first artificial intelligence
            system, J.A.R.V.I.S, to the latest technological marvel, E.D.I.T.H,
            Stark Industries has continued to push the boundaries of artificial
            intelligence, creating a legacy of innovation that has forever
            altered the landscape of technology. The following section explores
            the evolution of artificial intelligence at Stark Industries,
            showcasing the groundbreaking creations that have shaped the
            company's technological prowess.

            Dum-U is a robot that was created by Tony Stark at the age of 9
            years in his father’s workshop.However, Dum-U’s main feature is to
            register all his works and projects of tony using a video camera.
            This robotic arm is also seen helping tony during the creation of
            Mark ll, Mark XLII, and their testing.

            Similar to Dum-U, Dum-E is also a creation of 9-year-old Tony Stark.
            In the end, it is much more useful. Dum-E is a robotic arm which can
            learn through the behavior and actions done near its surrounding.
            However, he has always been seen as an assistant which helps him
            during his work.

            Not as advanced as J.A.R.V.I.S, H.O.M.E.R (Heuristically Operative
            Matrix Emulation Rostrum) is was created to manage the home of Tony

                Anthony Stark was an AI program that is a mimic copy of his mind and thinking ability. He created this ai which can take his place after his death.
                Stark was shipped to Riri Williams, a child prodigy who had caught Stark’s attention, so the A.I. could serve as a mentor to her.
                However the A.I. didn’t limit himself to being Riri’s companion, and he often hung around Tony Stark’s lab at the Stark Industries Main Campus.
                Since the A.I. was the reconstruction of a real person’s consciousness and not a digital program made from scratch, the lack of a physical body affected the A.I.

                TADASHI ai is a backup for Natural Language Interface created by Tony Stark. In MCU it’s seen when Tony was being prepared for the first of Battle of Sokovia.
                Instead of choosing TADASHI, he used FRIDAY for his suit. However, it gets its name after the reference to the film Big Hero 6, 
                where the robotic member of the titular team, Baymax, has its A.I. program stored in a chip labeled with the name of his creator, Tadashi Hamada.
